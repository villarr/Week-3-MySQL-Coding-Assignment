MySQL Week 3 assignment

Coding Steps:
You have been asked to create a database for a new social media application that your company is developing.
The database must store user data such as username, email, password, etc...
Users are able to post and comment. So, your database must also store post and comment data.
We need to know which user made which posts.
We also need to know which user made which comments, and which post a comment is on.
Posts and comments should both include the time they were created, and what the content of the post or comment is.

Create an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) using draw.io to model the database you will create. Insert a screenshot of the ERD in the screenshots section below.
